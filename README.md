# **Tiger POS ‚Äì Updated Project Documentation**

## 1. **Project Overview**

Tiger POS is a comprehensive point-of-sale web application built to serve retail businesses (including branches) like stores, hardware, pharmacies, stationery, etc. It helps with stock and sales management, user role administration, multi-branch oversight, reporting, and customer relations. The interface is designed to be intuitive to allow smooth daily operations across locations. ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])

---

## 2. **Technologies / Tools (what I infer so far & what you‚Äôve done)**

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (static site / UI prototype).
* Design / content: Images of dashboard, features, etc., pulled into the landing page. ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
* Likely some layout responsiveness: navigation, sections, menus etc.
* Probably planning or existing backend features (or will include) for user roles, branch management, security, etc. (these show in feature list) ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])

---

## 3. **Features Shown / Implemented**

From the site, these are already presented (some may be UI; backend maybe not fully working yet):

* **Landing / Home Page**

  * Hero section with tagline: *‚ÄúSolving All Your Retail Store Problems‚Äù* ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Navigation: Home, About, Features, Contact, Login links ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Get Started button ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])

* **About Section**

  * Description of what Tiger POS is, what it does (multi-branch, stock, sales, user management) ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])

* **Features Section**

  * Inventory Control (real-time tracking, alerts) ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Sales Management ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Customer Management (profiles, purchase history, rewards) ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * User Management (roles / permissions) ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Reporting & Analytics ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Multi-Branch Support ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Integration & Customization possibilities ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Security & Compliance ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])

* **Contact / Get in Touch**

  * Office address: Ongata Rongai, Nairobi, Kenya ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
  * Phone contacts provided ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])

---

## 4. **Design & UI/UX Observations**

* Clean, modern landing page.
* Good use of sections: Hero ‚Üí About ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Contact.
* Visuals / Images for features (icons or screenshot-type images) to illustrate each module. ([kamaugithub.github.io][1])
* Navigation is minimal, straightforward.
* Probably responsive (though not confirmed) since typical layout for such sites tend to adjust; maybe needs testing.
* Branding: ‚ÄúTiger POS‚Äù, with tagline, gives identity. Colors not clear from text, but likely stylized.

---

## 5. **What Looks Pending**

These are things I don‚Äôt see clearly or may need implementation:

* Actual working backend functionality (user roles, login, data storage) not confirmed.
* Multi-branch management probably needs database & logic.
* Real-time stock alerts, inventory adjustments etc.
* Integration with payment gateways / accounting tools.
* Showing dashboards or data analytics UI (beyond just images).
* Security/compliance details beyond what is mentioned in features.

---

## 7. **Next Steps (Based on Current View & What You Had Before)**

Here are updated next steps integrating what‚Äôs in your existing work & what the site shows:

  * Inventory management (CRUD operations + alerts)
  * Sales transactions (record, store, retrieve)
  * Reporting & analytics (dashboard charts, summaries)

* Ensure UI is responsive & works well on mobile/tablet.

* Flesh out integration points:

  * Payment gateways
  * Accounting or export features
  * Possibly third‚Äêparty APIs

* Security:

  * Data encryption
  * Secure authentication flows
  * Data validation & input sanitization

* UX enhancements:

  * Feedback / notifications
  * Error messages
  * Loading states

* Deployment & hosting:

  * Choose hosting / server
  * Set up domain
  * SSL / security
