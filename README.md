1. Project Overview

Tiger POS is a web-based,(front-end) prototype for a retail Point of Sale system intended to help businesses (e.g. hardware stores, pharmacies, stationery.) manage their inventory, sales, users, and reporting. Its goal is to provide a sleek, intuitive UI layer now, with plans for integrating full backend logic later.




 2. Technologies & Tools

These are the main technologies currently used in the project:

| Layer              | Technology / Tool                               | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend           | HTML, CSS, JavaScript                           | Building UI, interactions, layout           |
| CSS / Styling      | Custom styles (e.g. `dashstyle.css`)            | Dashboard styling and custom visual tweaks  |
| JS Modules / Logic | `script.js`, `search.js`, `light-dark.js`, etc. | Core UI logic, search, theme toggling, etc. |
| Asset Files        | `css/`, `images/`, `js/` directories            | Organizing styles, images, scripts          |
| Static Hosting     | GitHub Pages                                    | Host the front-end demo site                |

If/when backend is added later, possible technologies might include Node.js, Express, a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), etc.



 3. Features Implemented (UI & Static)

From what I observed, here are the features already represented or partially implemented:

* Landing / Home Page – hero, navigation, sections ([kamaugithub.github.io][2])
* About, Features, Contact sections ([kamaugithub.github.io][2])
* Navigation bar with links to Home / About / Features / Contact / Login ([kamaugithub.github.io][2])
* Dashboard mockup / preview image ([kamaugithub.github.io][2])
* Inventory / Sales / Customer / Reporting / Multi-Branch / Integration modules listed in Features ([kamaugithub.github.io][2])
* Static search logic / dummy data (in code files like `search.js`)
* Theme toggling / light-dark mode (`light-dark.js`)
* Modular CSS styling and layout
* Responsive or semi-responsive layout (needs testing)

These are mostly front-end / UI. The backend, dynamic data handling, secure auth, data persistence, etc., don’t seem to be fully present yet.

## 5. How to Run / Setup Locally

Here’s a quick guide so another developer (or future you) can spin this up and work:

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamaugithub/Tiger-2.git
   cd Tiger-2
   ```

2. Open the HTML files in a browser (e.g. `index.html`, `dashboard.html`)

   * Because this is currently a static front-end demo, you don’t need a server (though using a local dev server helps for JS modules).
   * You can run a simple HTTP server (Python, Node, etc.) to avoid CORS / module issues:

   ```bash
   # e.g. with Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or appropriate port) to see the UI.

4. Explore the JavaScript files, dummy data files, and UI to understand how data is being passed or displayed.

5. To extend or integrate backend, you would connect API endpoints, replace dummy modules, and refactor accordingly.

## 6. Pending / Future Work

Here are things I noticed that are **not yet implemented / need work**:

* **Backend / API & Data Persistence**

  * Authentication (login, signup, session management)
  * Role-based access control (staff, manager, admin)
  * Database models for users, inventory, sales, branches, etc.
  * CRUD operations for inventory, products, suppliers, customers
  * Real-time updates, stock alerts, low inventory warnings

* **Reporting & Analytics**

  * Dashboard charts (sales over time, inventory trends)
  * Export data (CSV, PDF)

* **Multi-Branch Management Logic**

  * Sync between branches
  * Permissions per branch

* **Integrations**

  * Payment gateway integration
  * Accounting software export / sync

* **UX / Usability Enhancements**

  * Loading states, error handling
  * Form validation, feedback messages
  * Responsiveness (mobile / tablet support)

* **Security & Data Integrity**

  * Input sanitization and validation
  * Encryption, hashing of sensitive data
  * Secure APIs (JWT, OAuth, etc.)

* **Testing & QA**

  * Unit tests, integration tests
  * End-to-end tests
  * Cross-browser testing

* **Deployment & DevOps**

  * Hosting (server, cloud)
  * CI/CD pipelines
  * SSL, domain, environment variables

## 7. Next Steps & Roadmap

Here’s a recommended roadmap to push this project closer to completion:

1. **Pick the backend stack** (Node.js + Express, Django, Laravel, etc.) and set up project skeleton.
2. **Implement authentication & user roles**.
3. **Build out data models and API endpoints** (CRUD for products, customers, suppliers, etc.).
4. **Connect frontend to backend** — replace dummy data modules with real API calls.
5. **Design the dashboard and reporting UI** — charts, tables, filter tools.
6. **Add features progressively** (e.g. stock alerts, branch syncing).
7. **Secure the application** (validate inputs, secure APIs, use HTTPS).
8. **Testing & quality assurance**.
9. **Deployment & CI/CD** (staging, production).
10. **Refinements & polish** (UX tweaks, performance optimization, mobile support).

You can break these into smaller milestones so that the handoff is smoother.

If you like, I can generate a **ready-to-paste README.md file** for you, or even a PDF/HTML project spec. Do you want me to prepare that and send it over so you just drop it in?
